### 🛡️ Task 1: Basic Network Scanning with Nmap

#### 🎯 Objective:

Perform a basic network scan using **Nmap** to identify open ports and services on a local or virtual machine.

#### 🧰 Tools Used:

* 🛰️ **Nmap** – The Network Mapper

#### 🪜 Steps Performed:

1. **Installed Nmap** on the Kali Linux VM using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
   ```
2. **Identified target machine's IP** using:

   ```bash
   ip a
   ```
3. **Performed version detection scan**:

   ```bash
   nmap -sV <target-ip>
   ```
4. Observed and analyzed open ports and services.

### 📄 Scan Result Snippet

Sample output from the scan:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh         OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3
80/tcp   open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
443/tcp  open  https       OpenSSL 1.1.1f
```

### 📘 Learnings:

* Understood how to install and use Nmap for port and service detection.
* Learned to analyze common services and interpret scan results.
* Gained experience in basic reconnaissance for penetration testing.

 # 🔥 Task 2 — Basic Firewall Configuration with UFW

 🎯 Goal
- Allow incoming **SSH (port 22)**
- Deny incoming **HTTP (port 80)**
- Display active UFW firewall rules

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. Installed UFW using:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install ufw -y

2. Reset UFW to remove old rules:
   sudo ufw reset

3. Set default policies:
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   sudo ufw default allow outgoing

4. Allowed SSH (port 22):
   sudo ufw allow 22

5. Denied HTTP (port 80):
   sudo ufw deny 80
 
6. Enabled UFW:
   sudo ufw enable

7. Checked current rules:
   sudo ufw status numbered
✅ Output Summary
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 22                         ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 80                         DENY IN     Anywhere
[ 3] 22 (v6)                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 4] 80 (v6)                    DENY IN     Anywhere (v6)

🧠 Notes
SSH (port 22) must be allowed before enabling UFW to prevent lockout.

UFW handles IPv6 rules by default if IPv6 is enabled.
